<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>There are N passengers boarding on an airplane one by one, with their tickets indicating their seats.<br />
However, the first passenger lost his ticket, he decide to randomly choose a seat(could be his own, or one of the othersâ€™). Every following passenger will take their own seat if not taken, otherwise randomly choose one from the vacancies.<br />
Whatâ€™s the probability that the last(Nth) passenger got his own seat?</p>

<h3 id="analysis">Analysis</h3>
<p>Itâ€™s easy to infer the answer for N=1 and N=2, which are 1 and \(\frac{1}{2}\). <br />
However, the general answer is not \(\frac{1}{N}\). Because itâ€™s obvious that the \(1^{st}\) passenger will take his own seat at the odd of \(\frac{1}{N}\), leaving all the rest passengers get their own seats. So the answer should be lager than that because it is still possible for the \(N^{th}\) to get his own seat if the \(1^{st}\) takes otherâ€™s.<br />
Letâ€™s denote the answer as \(P(N)\) and the probability that randomly choose from n othersâ€™ seats leaveing the \(N^{th}\) getting his own as \(Q(n)\).<br />
For the \(1^{st}\):</p>
<ol>
  <li>if takes seat 1 at \(\frac{1}{N}\), then the rest are all set, the last can definately get his own seat.</li>
  <li>if takes seat 2 at \(\frac{1}{N}\), then the \(2^{nd}\) will choose seat 1 at \(\frac{1}{N-1}\), and choose others at \(Q(n-2)\).</li>
  <li>if takes seat i at \(\frac{1}{N}\), then the \(i^{th}\) will choose seat 1 at \(\frac{1}{N -i+1}\), and choose others at \(Q(n-i)\).</li>
</ol>

<p>\(P(N)=\frac{1}{N}+\frac{N-1}{N}Q(n-1)\)<br />
\(P(N)=\frac{1}{N}+\frac{1}{N}(\frac{1}{N-1}+Q(n-2))+\frac{1}{N}(\frac{1}{N-2}+Q(n-3))\cdots+\frac{1}{N}(\frac{1}{2}+Q(1))\)<br />
\(Q(1)=0\)</p>

<h3 id="result">Result</h3>
<p>We derivative the chain rule of \(Q(i)\):<br />
\(Q(n)=Q(n-1)+\frac{1}{n^2}\\  
Q(1)=0\)</p>

<p>Then we can get:<br />
\(Q(n)=\Sigma_{i=2}^{n}\frac{1}{i^2}\\  
P(N)=\frac{1}{N}(1+(N-1)\Sigma_{i=2}^{N-1}\frac{1}{i^2})\)</p>
